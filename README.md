# commonplace

> A structured library of your own professional voice, assembled by AI when you need it.

**TL;DR** — You've written the perfect email before, and now just can't find it. Commonplace remembers it for you, understands the context, and helps you write the next one faster without starting from scratch.

## The original idea

Before productivity apps, before note-taking software, before the cloud, there was **the commonplace book**. 

Scholars, writers, and thinkers from the Renaissance onward kept personal collections of quotes, arguments, formulations, and ideas worth reusing, organized not by source but by purpose. The point was never to archive everything; it was **to build a working library** of language that could be assembled into something new when the moment required it.

## The problem it solves

This project is a modern version of that idea, built specifically for people who write professionally and repeatedly — solution architects, consultants, account executives, anyone who spends a significant portion of their working life composing emails, proposals, and explanations that are never quite the same but never quite different enough to start from scratch every time.

Most professionals have accumulated years of well-crafted language — a perfect way to frame a risk, a paragraph that always lands in a proposal, a closing line that consistently works — and most of that language lives scattered across sent folders, old documents, and fading memory. Every time a similar situation comes up, they write it again from scratch or settle for something worse than what they once wrote and forgot.

## How it works

You bring the fragments, the formulations, the pieces of writing you're proud of, and the system helps you find the right ones for the situation at hand and assembles them into a coherent draft that sounds like you — because it is you, just organized. The goal is not to generate generic text but to surface and combine the specific language you have already proven works in your context.
